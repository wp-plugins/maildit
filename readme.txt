With the Maildit WordPress plugin users can easily create digital newsletters within WordPress. 
The newsletters can then easily be send via Campaign Monitor, Mail Chimp and / or MailToMail. 
The advantage of Maildit is that you can manage your newsletters within your own WordPress 
installation. This allows you to make use of the WordPress template system. This makes it 
easy to integrate your latest post in your newsletters.
